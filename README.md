# OpenSourceEtlFramework
This is an ETL platform based on a metadata-driven framework, built using open source tools. In particular, this platform uses Python, Kubernetes, and Terraform as the primary components of the engine.

The destination database is managed using Liquibase. The database system is intended to be open-ended, but it would be well suited for Snowflake.
